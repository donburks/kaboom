# Kaboom!

## A bomb-defusing game from the minds of Lighthouse Labs

Participants are faced with the bomb-defusing challenge. Ideally, participants will find the `kaboom.js` script after a brief intro to how web pages are built, and how logic tests work. In there, they can find the `if` statement in `updateTimer` and figure out how to change the code so that it will stop the kaboom! This can be done by altering the boolean logic, or by commenting/deleting the `utils.kaboom()` line.
