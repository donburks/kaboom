          <h2>Welcome to the Coding Challenge!</h2>
          <p>Today, you are going to have to take two simple lessons that we will give you, and use that knowledge to change the code to defuse a bomb that threatens to explode! The city is counting on you, so make your efforts count! Continue reading below for a few simple lessons on how a computer understands code. These lessons will give you all the information you need to solve this challenge.</p>

          <h3>How a Web Page is Assembled</h3> 
          <p>A web page consists of two main parts: a <strong>head</strong> and a <strong>body</strong>. The body is the content, it is what shows up on the screen. The head, however, is where the configuration for the page is stored. The browser uses the <strong>head</strong> section to get its instructions for <em>HOW</em> that content should be displayed. This can include the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which tell the browser about the appearance of the text. It can also include <strong>scripts</strong> that will run code on a page. You can always recognize these in a webpage's code because they look like this: <code>&lgt;script src=&quot;filename.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>. This points to another file which will contain code that runs on the webpage to give it its extra functionality.</p>

          <h3>Logic</h3>
          <p>A computer runs by making a series of logical decisions, much like a human does. A human might say, &quot;If it is raining, use your umbrella.&quot; Where a computer will say, &quot;<code>If the value stored in x is equal to 10, output 'Ten'</code>&quot;</p>
          <p>Study the code that is included in the webpage, and see if you can figure out where an <code>if</code> statement is testing some logical condition which would make the bomb explode.</p>
          <p><strong>Tip: </strong> You can stop any line of code from running by putting <code>//</code> in front of the line. That comments it out and tells the computer to ignore it.</p>
